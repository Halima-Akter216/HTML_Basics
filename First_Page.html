 <h1>I want to learn something</h1>
 <h2>I have to be something special</h2>
 <h3>Have to build myself</h3>
 <h4>Have to make a strong base</h4>
 <h5>Have to be capable for hard work</h5>
 <p> I started to learn HTML which is a <u>markup language</u> by which we can design websites.Here 
    only <i>the content of body section will show to the browser</i> and <i>the content of head section
    will be shown to the tab</i> of the browser. <b>And here <u>p for paragraph, b for bold, i for italic,
    u for underline,h for heading.</u></b>
    There are 5 h which are h1,h2,h3,h4,h5.
