 <h1>I want to learn something</h1>
 <h2>I have to be something special</h2>
 <h3>Have to build myself</h3>
 <h4>Have to make a strong base</h4>
 <h5>Have to be capable for hard work</h5>
 <p> 
	I started to learn HTML which is a 
	<u>
		markup language
	</u> 
		by which we can design websites.Here 
		only 
	<i>
		the content of body section will show to the browser
	</i> 
		and 
	<i>
		the content of head section will be shown to the tab
	</i> 
		of the browser. 
	<b>
		And here 
	<u>
		p for paragraph, b for bold, i for italic, u for underline,h for heading,a for linking.
	</u>
	</b>
 	There are 5 h which are h1,h2,h3,h4,h5.
	
 </p>
 <p>
	If we want to write attributes then we have to write it after the name of opening tag via space.
	And to define the link we need to write the name of attribute like href. 
	After that we have to declare the value of attribe.
 </p>
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Click Me</a>
 <p>
	For inserting image we need to use img tag.And there are no closing tag in img that's why 
	we have to use / in the end of starting tag as well as declare the source of image 
	which is named as src.

 </p>
 <img src="Image/halima_pic.jpg" width="100px" height="100px" />
 <p>
	For creating button we need button tag.
    <button>
	Submit Here
    </button>
 </p>
 <p>
	There are <b>2 types of html List.</b>
	which are <u><b>Ordered List & Unordered List.</u></b>
	We use ul tag for unordered list & to store the items of the list we use li tag
	which stands for list item. 
	<ul>
	    <li> Item 1 </li>
	    <li> Item 2 </li>
	</ul>
	Here we can see the bullet points before the items because of using the unordered list.
 </p>
 <p>
	For ordered list we have to use ol tag which stands for ordered list.
	<ol>
	    <li> Item 1 </li>
	    <li> Item 2 </li>
	</ol>
	Here we can see the serial number before the items because we use ordered list.
 </p>
 <p>
	There are a title attribute in paragraph by which we can see the title of that paragraph by keeping
	our cursor on that line.
 </p>
 <p title = "This is a html code"> Hello Everyone!This is Halima</p>
 
 <p>
	For making a horizontal line we have hr tag which have no ending tag.
	<hr />
 </p>
 <p>
	For line spacing we use br tag which means line break and it has no closing tag.

 </p>
 <p> Hey Guys! </p>
 <br />
 <p> Hey Guys! </p>
 <p>
	If we want to customize our line break or spacing or something like this then we need to use
	pre tag.
 </p>
 <pre>
	Are you guys really enjoying?
		It is a multiple choice question.
                    So you have only 2 options. Yes or No.
